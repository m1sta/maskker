        <h3>What is Maskker</h3>
        <p>Maskker is a javascript module which allows your users to authenticate with your site by selecting two photos they
            have stored in their camera roll or on their computer. </p>

        <p>It makes use of the fact that each photo taken by a smartphone user is subtly unique. Maskker uses a perceptual image
            hashing algorithm so that small changes to a photo caused by compression or modest resize don't cause any problems.
            Images are never sent to any server, they're simply hashed in-browser and then discarded. Maskker can be used
            anywhere but it was designed to be used for sites where user's are commonly incognito.' </p>
        <p>We believe that choosing two photos to authenticate yourself with is a lot easier than remembering a strong password
            that looks like 'fn&71!dnkjsd'.</p>

        <h3>Demo</h3>
        <div id="example">
            <script src="maskker.min.js"></script>
            <span id="maskker"><span style="color:blue; cursor: pointer;">Demo: Click or tap here and select two images</span></span>
            <br><br><div id="hashes"></div>
            <script>
                maskker.register({
                selector:'#maskker',
                onProgress: function (progress) { document.getElementById("hashes").innerText = "Processing: " + progress },
                onComplete: function (user, pass, name) { 
                    document.getElementById("hashes").innerHTML =  "User: " + user + "<br>Pass: " + pass + "<br>Name: " + name}
            })
            </script>
        </div>
        <h3>Usage</h3>
        <p> Just include maskker.min.js on your page and then use the maskker.register() function. Masker will output three things:
            a username, a password, and a friendly name.
        </p>
        <p>The friendly name is provided as an indicator to let users know they provided the correct to images. It's provided
            to prevent them needing to input a name that's really not important most of the time. View the source of this
            page for a working example.</p>
